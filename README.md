There are two agents playing the well known game Rock, paper, scissors. Each agent has an initial probability distribution of choosing paper, rock or scissors (eg. 40% for paper, 40% for rock and 20% for scissors, random distribution). They play the game multiple times by ACL message passing and each of them learns the distribution of its opponent. Based on the acquired knowledge they can adapt their strategy to maximize their chances to win. The goal is to show how the game goes on and how the agents learn to fit their behaviours to the opponent's choices.
